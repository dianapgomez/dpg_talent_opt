# Talent Optimization for ABC Copr

Diana P. Gómez

## **Description**

This project is part of Adalab Data Analytics Bootcamp and corresponds to the evaluation for Module 3. 
The project is based on a fictional case in which we have been hired to develop a data analysis project for a company called ABC Corp, which requires our services to reduce employee turnover and improve job satisfaction. Our mission is to identify key factors that influence job satisfaction and, ultimately, employee retention. In this project, we will present the results of our exploratory data analysis and analyze the findings to provide ABC Corporation with valuable insights to inform their strategic decisions.
The company has provided us with a csv (`hr_raw_data.csv`) containing all the information we might need

## **💡 Key Insights**  


- The profiles that remain with the company the longest are those in the highest ranks and earn the best salaries.
- The profiles with the highest turnover and the highest probability of attrition are those with lower rank, lower educational level and lower salary.
- Although the company is moving towards parity, there is still a gender pay gap in the same job positions. There is also a noticeably lower presence of women than men.
- The usual parameters of satisfaction do not prove to be relevant in this case. However, there is a high turnover in the sectors of employees who do not progress in their positions.
